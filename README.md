## Reporting issues with examples

A great way to contribute to the examples is to send a detailed report when you encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report, and will thank you for it!

Check that [our issue database](https://github.com/saucelabs/visual-examples/issues) doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue. If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified of updates. Do _not_ leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments, as they only clutter the discussion, and don't help resolving it. However, if you have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information that may help resolve the issue, please leave a comment.

Also, include the steps required to reproduce the problem if possible and applicable. This information will help us review and fix your issue faster. When sending lengthy log-files, consider posting them as a gist (https://gist.github.com).

Don't forget to remove sensitive data from your logfiles before posting (you can replace those parts with "REDACTED").
